# My-Shell
This repository contains my C code for making a Shell from scratch.
The `execvp()` function has been used for the same. To implement `cd` command `chdir()` in-built C function has been used.

It also contains the original feature of repeating last performed command by giviing input- `!!`.

Also, there is additional feature of checking the `history`, which I implemented by storing the previously performed commands in an array.
